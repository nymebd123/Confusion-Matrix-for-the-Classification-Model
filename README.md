# Confusion Matrix Analysis for Thermal Comfort Prediction Project

## What the Confusion Matrix Analysis Does
This project evaluates the performance of Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and XGBoost machine learning models for thermal comfort prediction in educational buildings using two sampling strategies (SMOTE + Tomek Links and SMOTE + ENN). The analysis includes the comparison of model performance metrics through Confusion Matrix evaluation.

## Why the Confusion Matrix Analysis is Useful
The Confusion Matrix provides insights into the predictive performance of machine learning models in handling imbalanced datasets for thermal comfort prediction. It helps in understanding the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of each model under different sampling strategies.

## Getting Started with the Confusion Matrix Analysis
To explore the Confusion Matrix analysis:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Review the code related to Confusion Matrix generation and interpretation for RF, DT, and XGBoost models.
- Examine how different sampling strategies impact the performance metrics presented in the Confusion Matrix.
